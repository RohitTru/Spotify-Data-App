monthly Spotify playlist Generator

For sometime now I have been creating a playlist every month for music I find on spotify. Its a system that emergently came about as I used spotify over the years to stream, discover and store my music. I would like to try to create an app that uses the spotify app and can maybe keep track of whatever songs I happen to be listening the most in a given period of time and then curates them into a playlist for that month over time.

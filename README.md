# Spotify Monthly Playlist Generator


## Description
For sometime now I have been creating a playlist every month for music I find on spotify. Its a system that emergently came about as I used spotify over the years to stream, discover and store my music. I would like to try to create an app that uses the spotify app and can maybe keep track of whatever songs I happen to be listening the most in a given period of time and then curates them into a playlist for that month over time.

## UPDATE R&D.01
okay so bare with me. Im gonna try to live in this repository for a little bit until I can figure out how I can successfully use this github tooling and also learn everything I need to deploy an application I have in mind. So its just going to be a bit messy and I'm not going to know what I'm doing around of lot of corners, but hey we all start somewhere. So this was the project folder I was using to build this application in and I think I'm going to keep just learning and building in this folder. Hopefully I can iterate some organization in here, foster a lot of learning and also build something cool and relatively useful.

    So to start. I really want to get into microservice architecture. That is a lot of learning I have learned. I think I have some idea from the stage I got this project to, I think I should be put together a microservice application with flask, a database that collects my spotify data. So yeah lets get started.

    In this update where going to clean up this repository a bit and kinda get some sort of system going for keeping track of tasks or updates and just build out some organization for future development and learning

    We are going to also remove the docker files and we will return back to docker later.



## To-Do
